# Infrastructure Configuration

### Steps to run the local setup

* run `docker-compose up -d`
* after containers are up, whenever you want to start your local dev setup use the `start.sh` script, this will stop all running containers to avoid port conflict and run the `smarthome` containers

### Notes
* Make sure you have docker installed and enabled, for more information visit the [oficial Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ )
